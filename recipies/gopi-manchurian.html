        <h2>A mouth watering Gopi Manchurian recipe that can be made in just 30 mins for a serving of 2</h2>
        <p>This gobi Manchurian is one of my favorite gobi, or cauliflower, recipes that is available at many Indo Chinese-style restaurants. It is a spicy dish that's sure to leave your family wanting more! Occasionally, I even love to bake the cauliflower to lower the calories. Remember, baking will take away from the crispiness of fried cauliflower.</p>
